### Included presets

#### Speakers (Default)

General preset for speakers, designed to work best with small bookshelf speakers or a mini-system.

#### Laptop Speakers (Default)

Preset targeted at laptop speakers, designed mainly for my laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E540), may or not not work well
for other similar ThinkPad models. Designed to enhance bass as much as possible without creating distortion or
negatively effecting other frequencies.
